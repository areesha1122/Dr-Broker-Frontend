## Setup Guide

### Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Dr-Broker-Frontend server running

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone  https://github.com/areesha1122/Dr-Broker-Frontend
   ```

   ````

2. Install dependencies:

   ````shell
   cd dr-broker-frontend
   npm install
   ```

   ````

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   Replace `http://localhost:3000` with the base URL of your Dr-Broker-Frontend server.

   ````

4. Run the application:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   ````

## Operational Use

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the API endpoints to manage doctor profiles, patient profiles, appointments, treatments, and medicines. The specific endpoints and usage will depend on the implementation details of your project.

You can integrate the backend with a frontend application or test the endpoints using API testing tools (e.g., Postman, curl).
